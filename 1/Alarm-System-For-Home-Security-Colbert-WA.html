<p>An on-site ringer will normally activate a bell or siren connected to the building when the alarm is tripped. Similarly, when an automated dialer alarm is tripped, a telephone call is instantly put to the police or fire departments, and a pre-recorded statement is played when that call is answered. Automatic dialer alarms are not permitted to dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events.

If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not think that these concerns alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
