<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be considered.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
