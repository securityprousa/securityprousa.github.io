<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the precise same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
