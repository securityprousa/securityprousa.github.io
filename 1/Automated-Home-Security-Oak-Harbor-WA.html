<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with fixed lens are normally smaller than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most excellent reaction time of all home security companies we evaluated. Their timeframe for response in under 10 seconds, which we must admit is quite exceptional.

And to be honest, we're not extremely impressed by ADT's cameras in the first location. What you're spending for is mainly that huge name in blue. </p>
