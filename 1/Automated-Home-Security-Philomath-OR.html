<p>This is the best-scoring wise alarm we evaluated. It was very simple to set up, as the components are pre-paired to the base station, and it was quick to set off when any of the sensors were activated. We like that it features both internal and external sirens and will even work with Philips Hue smart lights, too. The directions are very extensive and the 200m range of the alarm means it can be used to protect sheds and garages along with your home.

<p>Expenses for systems differ. Larger systems that provide full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most expensive alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly option. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>
