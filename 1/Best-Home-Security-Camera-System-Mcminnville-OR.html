<p>ADT doesn't have the greatest customer support reputation among the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 problems on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this approximately the fact that ADT has several million more clients than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations. There's a great deal of discuss wireless cameras, but that term can be confusing.

<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting.
