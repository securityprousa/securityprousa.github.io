<p>First and foremost, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost two years of night, day and usage images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We have actually seen it highlight moths, mice, and automobiles.</p>

You're just accountable for the monthly monitoring fee and any optional upgrades. There's likewise a rate match assurance.</p>
