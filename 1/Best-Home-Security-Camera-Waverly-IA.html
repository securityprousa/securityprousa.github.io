With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications may appear comparable, though if you were able to see within, the distinctions become apparent and distinct.

Usually, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and once the lighting ends up being low or absent (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.
