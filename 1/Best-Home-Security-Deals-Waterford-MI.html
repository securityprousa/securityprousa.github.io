<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon authorities department personnel, requires registration, assessment of charges for excessive incorrect alarm system, provides treatments for repeat offenders, and offers an effective date. Another huge function is night vision. You may also consider a camera with a built-in motion-activated light-- all the better to frighten you with, my dear!
