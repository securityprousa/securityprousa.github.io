<p>Cove is like a somewhat fancier version of SimpliSafe. Both systems cost precisely the same, however if you like the appearance of a touchscreen control board, then Cove will offer your design a little bit of an increase.

<p>We liked Alder for their fast reaction times and general adaptability. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and uncomplicated streamlined. Otherwise, this company uses a similar feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks.
