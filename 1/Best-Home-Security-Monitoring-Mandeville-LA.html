Some systems can be set up to permit deactivation of individual sensing units or groups.  High-end systems enable numerous access codes, and might even allow them to be used only as soon as, or on specific days, or only in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center ought to organize an oral code to be provided by a licensed person in case of incorrect alarms, so the monitoring center can be ensured that an additional alarm reaction is unnecessary.

<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
