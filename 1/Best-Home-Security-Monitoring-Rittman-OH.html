<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the required systems is needed. There are only two alternatives if there are no as-built documents supplying performance and setup details to make this integration work. The very first choice, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is reluctant or not available to supply those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
