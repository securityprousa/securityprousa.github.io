When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>Nest Secure offers loads of smart gadgetry-- a lot so that you may get overwhelmed by all of the alternatives. But hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd expect absolutely nothing less! We really took pleasure in using Nest Secure for home protection and automation, but remember that it can get expensive if you don't currently have a Nest clever home environment set up.

Not fantastic, not terrible, but with a truly easy setup procedure (and trust me, that truly is a killer function when it comes to smart cameras.) This more recent variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>
