<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
