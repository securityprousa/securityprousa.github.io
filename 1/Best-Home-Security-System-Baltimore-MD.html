<h3>Security Alarm Monitoring Baltimore MD 21215</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
