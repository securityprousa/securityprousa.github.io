<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
