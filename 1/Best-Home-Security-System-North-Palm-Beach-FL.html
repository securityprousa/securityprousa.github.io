<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

Bear in mind that the more additionals and features you add to your system, the larger the price. Some top-tier packages cost upward of $60 each month.
