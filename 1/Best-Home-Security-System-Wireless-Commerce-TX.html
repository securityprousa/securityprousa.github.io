We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
