<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
