As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
