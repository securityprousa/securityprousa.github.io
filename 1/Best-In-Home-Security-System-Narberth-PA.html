<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more circuitry.

Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera separately, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
