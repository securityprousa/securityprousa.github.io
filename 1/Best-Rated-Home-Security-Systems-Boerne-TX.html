<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, often utilize battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have less expensive start-up expenses, but might stop working if the batteries are not maintained. Depending on distance and building products, several wireless repeaters might be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel dependably. A wireless system can be relocated to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who lease or who move regularly. The more crucial wireless connection for security is the one between the control board and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm protects against a burglar cutting a cable television or from failures of a web provider. This full wireless setup is commonly described as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are frequently combined with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the facilities control system contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take suitable action, such as contacting homeowner, alerting authorities, or dispatching personal security forces.
