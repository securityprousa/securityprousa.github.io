<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over long distances.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
