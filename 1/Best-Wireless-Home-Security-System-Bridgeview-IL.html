<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
