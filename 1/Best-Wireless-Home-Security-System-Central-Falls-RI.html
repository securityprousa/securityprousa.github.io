<p>The Randolph Municipality Authorities Department is asking businesses and citizens to register their privately-owned surveillance camera systems. As our officers respond to reports of criminal activity in our community, they may be able to use the information or video caught on these security cameras to assist in the apprehension and prosecution of the criminals involved.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If recording video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
