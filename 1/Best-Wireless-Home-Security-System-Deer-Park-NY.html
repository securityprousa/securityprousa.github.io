We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
