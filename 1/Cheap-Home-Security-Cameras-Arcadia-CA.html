<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
