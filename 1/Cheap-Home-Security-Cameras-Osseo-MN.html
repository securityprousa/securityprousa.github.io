<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
