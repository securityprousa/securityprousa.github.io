<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't just for catching a thief in the act, however. They're also useful for casual home monitoring. Put on tables, counter tops, and racks, they permit you to watch on what your animals are doing, understand when the kids get back from school, or find who's been striking the liquor cabinet.
