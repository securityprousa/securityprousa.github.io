<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software.

But Netatmo has broadened its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
