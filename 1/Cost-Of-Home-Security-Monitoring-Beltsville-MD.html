<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
