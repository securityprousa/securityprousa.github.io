Almost all of the current Do It Yourself and high-end home security systems use support for voice control through Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and sometimes Apple Siri, which allows you to open doors, change thermostat settings, open the garage, and arm or deactivate your system with a spoken command to a linked device like an Amazon Echo or a Google Home speaker. Many also use support for IFTTT (If This Then That) applets, which use triggers from IFTTT-compatible web services and devices to produce an action. For example, you can develop an applet that says if a garage door is opened to turn on the floodlight.</p>

<p>The very best home security systems have expert monitoring. We know it's an additional expenditure on a monthly basis, but we generally advise it. At $199 for the basic five-piece bundle, the Ring Alarm is one of the most economical security systems on the marketplace.

<h3>Surveillance Cameras Wireless in Oxford MS</h3>
<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously outstanding piece of technology. For beginners, it looks lovely: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you picture a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.
