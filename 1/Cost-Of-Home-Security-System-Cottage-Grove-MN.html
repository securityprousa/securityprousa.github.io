<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems planned to summon cops department workers, needs registration, assessment of fees for extreme false burglar alarms, supplies procedures for repeat wrongdoers, and supplies an effective date. Another big feature is night vision. You might likewise consider a camera with an integrated motion-activated light-- all the much better to scare you with, my dear!
