The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have actually a cable connected though, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective burglars.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
