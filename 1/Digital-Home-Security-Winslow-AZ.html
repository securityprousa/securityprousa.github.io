<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not featured upfront costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

<h3>Digital Home Security in Arizona</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), but it sure has actually gained rather the excitement over the years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security set that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you select the free self-monitor" option.</p>
<p>No matter the resolution, try to pick a camera with a relatively wide field of view (viewing angle) and ensure it can record clear night vision video. The majority of cameras utilize IR (infrared) LEDs to provide black-and-white night video, but there are a few out there that usage white light to deliver full-color night video. Try to find a camera with a night vision range of at least 30 feet.</p>
