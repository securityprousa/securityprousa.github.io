<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
