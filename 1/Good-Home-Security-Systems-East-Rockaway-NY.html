This makes the best monitored alarm systems more pricey than routine Do It Yourself security options, but if you wish to safeguard your home or business, this extra level of security is well worth the cost.

<p>The drawback? It's very easy to commit security mistakes that will leave your home susceptible. The minute you eliminate of signal range or turn your phone to plane mode is the minute you've left your house open.

Still, the unmonitored system is much less pricey and therefore is still the better alternative for many who are only concerned about cost. </p>
