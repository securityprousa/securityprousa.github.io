<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the very same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one!

If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it might be a crime, yet the same individual might position a surveillance camera then remotely view an individual within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
