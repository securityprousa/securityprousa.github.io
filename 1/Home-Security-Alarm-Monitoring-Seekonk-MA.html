<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive total per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>

When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that details when they appear at your home.
