<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>While many providers give you the option to include both indoor and outdoor cameras to your security plan, SimpliSafe's choice is restricted to one indoor surveillance camera.
