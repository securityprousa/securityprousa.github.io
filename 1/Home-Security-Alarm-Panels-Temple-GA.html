The more advanced cameras in the market permit two-way audio between people on either side of the video surveillance system.

<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
