Methods consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and getting in touch with leading scientists to inquire about forthcoming evaluations. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
