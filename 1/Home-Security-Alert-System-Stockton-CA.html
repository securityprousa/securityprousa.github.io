<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>Night vision: Many burglaries take place after dark, so this feature is nearly as important as motion detection. Technically, many home security cameras support infrared LED lighting, versus true night vision based on image intensification or thermal vision. Be that as it may, some camera's will change to night vision automatically in low-light conditions, while others enable you to tailor when and how it should be activated.</p>

<p>The occurrence of video surveillance systems as a service (VSSaaS) service has actually surged over the last few years. Although local storage works in its own respect, it has a number of caveats.

<h3>Smart Home Security System in California</h3>
<p>Smart alarms are simply as efficient as traditional alarm systems however they do not always have an external siren that rests on the front of your house, which can act as a deterrent to intruders.
