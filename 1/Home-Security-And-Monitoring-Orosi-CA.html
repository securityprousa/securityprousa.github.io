<p>Night vision: Most break-ins occur after dark, so this feature is almost as crucial as motion detection.

Convenience is the significant reason individuals change to wireless," says Du, and it's difficult to argue against a 10-minute setup when the wired option needs professional installation of wires beneath your house.</p>
<p>Something that should be considered when installing CCTV cameras is how they will be powered, and how electrical wiring will be run throughout the building.

The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be taken up versus the quality of image needed or preferred). The greatest photo quality of DVD is just somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>It's not almost security from theft, either.
