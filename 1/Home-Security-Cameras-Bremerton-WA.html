<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply wouldn't connect. An assistance window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate assisted her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- but the representative apologized and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>

<p>Equipment Cost - With some companies, like SimpliSafe, you pay for all the equipment upfront. You can begin for about $200 or less for vital equipment, and paid monitoring isn't required.

<p>Night vision: Many burglaries happen after dark, so this function is almost as important as motion detection. Technically, a lot of home security cameras support infrared LED illumination, versus real night vision based on image augmentation or thermal vision.

<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little bit of a problem is between finding and tape-recording movement.

If a wicked crook was fast enough, they might get past the camera prior to it had time to tape them.</p>
