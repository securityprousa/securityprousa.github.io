<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is vital. In reality, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a person and an automobile, for instance, enables you to cut down on unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
