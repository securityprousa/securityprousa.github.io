The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a free tier of cloud storage, so you need to invest a minimum of $3 each month if you wish to conserve any videos. And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
