<h3>Wireless Camera System Lexington KY 40517</h3>
<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has detected trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Note that these sirens may breach local noise control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
