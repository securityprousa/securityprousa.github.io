<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
