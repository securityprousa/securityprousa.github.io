<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even activate incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
