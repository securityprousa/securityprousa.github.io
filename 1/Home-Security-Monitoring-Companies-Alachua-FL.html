<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
