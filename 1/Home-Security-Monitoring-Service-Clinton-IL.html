<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with typically difficult and long agreements, and often depend on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they provide little advantage.
