<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
