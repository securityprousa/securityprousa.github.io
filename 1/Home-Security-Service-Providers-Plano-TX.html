<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it ought to be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month.

<p>As soon as the alarm company representative has actually made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a written proposition and a copy of the contract you will need to sign.
