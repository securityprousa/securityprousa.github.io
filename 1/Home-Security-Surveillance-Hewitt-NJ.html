<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
<p>The alarm user has thirty (30) days from the date of notification to submit an appeal. Appeals should remain in writing and accompanied by supporting paperwork. Supporting documentation for appeal might be subsequent police reports, documentation of power interruptions, insurance coverage claims and photos of actual damage done to home. The Alarm Division manager will figure out whether to give the appeal with periodic consultation with the Director.</p>
