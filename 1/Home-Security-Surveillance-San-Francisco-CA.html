<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and setup details to make this combination work, there are just two choices. The very first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unwilling or unavailable to supply those details) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to replace and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>A self-monitored system ought to be smart. It ought to have the ability to follow rules with cause-and-effect relationships between various devices.

Hardwired systems need minimal upkeep, and except a general power failure, are harder to interrupt.
