This normally involves finding a spot for your camera, creating an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

This action combined with an electrical existing (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to spot a fault on that zone or circuit.

When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
