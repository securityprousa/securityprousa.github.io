The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to tape these codes and use numerous splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key caught throughout the network healing.</p>
