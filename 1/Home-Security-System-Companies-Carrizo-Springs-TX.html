Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a dispute that's frequently manipulated by elements such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that trigger incorrect alarms. While improvements in recent years have made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own distinct wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
