<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Asset protection gadgets are created to secure particular, concrete properties, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household heirlooms. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. The sensing unit will set off an alarm if the product to which the device has been connected is moved or disrupted.</p>
<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm signs hoping they'll discourage potential burglars. These signs might be affixed to a front door, a prominent window, published in the front backyard, or at the top of a driveway.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.
