<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful enemy, since the interruption of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly safeguards data by avoiding it from being sent. The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the destructive assailant to tape-record these codes and use various breaking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security crucial captured during the network healing.</p>
