<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire household will love. Expert installation with expert monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT expertly install and monitor your system-- you don't need to lift a finger or babysit signals. Over my 25 plus year profession in the security market, I have actually investigated, sold, installed, and because we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I wish to confess.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems generally do not included upfront fees. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
