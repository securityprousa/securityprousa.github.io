<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so crucial?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows somebody to find what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Picture a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are looking for in the taped video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful solution for collecting and capturing criminals evidence.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; everything within their focus ability is recorded. That is to state, CCTV cameras are quite un-focused when it concerns isolating the images of an active occurrence about to take place. But you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to contribute to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
