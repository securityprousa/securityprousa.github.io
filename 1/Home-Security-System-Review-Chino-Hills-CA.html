<p>A few of our favorite companies permit you to DIY your alarm installation, while others send out an expert to do the job.

<p>Vivint's monitoring charges are in line with our other top security companies, which is excellent provided the sophisticated proprietary equipment and services that come with a Vivint home security system. We also like that Vivint gives you the alternative to buy your equipment outright, which suggests you're off the hook for a long-lasting contract-- but that does require a substantial up-front payment.</p>
<p>While Scout's usually simple on the wallet, it does have one big failing: it charges additional for self-monitoring.

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer support experience varies widely depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
