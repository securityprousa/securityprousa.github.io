All these factors to consider will affect what system you eventually choose. For instance, if you require to capture high-definition surveillance video over extended periods, bandwidth is a consideration.</p>

The 2nd classification of camera, commercial-grade cameras, typically begins at about $400 (US) per camera-- a substantially higher price.

A lot of cameras use IR (infrared) LEDs to deliver black-and-white night video, but there are a couple of out there that use white light to deliver full-color night video. Look for a camera with a night vision range of a minimum of 30 feet.</p>
