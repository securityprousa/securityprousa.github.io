<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
