<p>In The Sims 2, a burglar alarm will cover the entire space it is put in. Burglar alarms can not be placed outdoors, unless the moveobjects cheat is used. Each space with a door to the outdoors should have an alarm. If cheats are utilized to place a burglar alarm outdoors, it will cover the whole outside area, obstructed only by outdoor fences.</p>

And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
