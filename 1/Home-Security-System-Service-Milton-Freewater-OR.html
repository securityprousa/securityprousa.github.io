<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing opportunity for criminal abuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level police official in Washington, DC was caught using police databases to gather info on patrons of a gay club.

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really irritating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too costly, and not great.</p>

A picture of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating happens.</p>
