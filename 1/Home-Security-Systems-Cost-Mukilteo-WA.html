<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents.

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't believe that these concerns change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current recommendation.</p>
