<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just wouldn't link. An aid window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was a problem with the circuit board. Certainly not perfect-- but the rep said sorry and shipped her replacement control board overnight.</p>

For my money, systems like these offer some of the very best value for your home security dollar.</p>
<h2>Intelligent Video Surveillance Solution Troutman</h2>

<p>Bosch, Sony's partner, will continue to disperse the Sony branded video security products till December. Later on, their partnership will be terminated, according to a Bosch rep. This comes less than 4 years after revealing in 2016 that Sony's video security sales and marketing associates would sign up with a recently formed team at Bosch, which would serve and support Sony's video security consumers in all markets other than Japan.</p>
