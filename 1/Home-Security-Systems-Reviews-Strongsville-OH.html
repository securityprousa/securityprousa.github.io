<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
