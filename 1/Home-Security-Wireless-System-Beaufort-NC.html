<p>The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's courteous, knowledgeable experts. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was courteous, prompt, and honest (even reducing his bill after realizing they didn't need to install one camera).
