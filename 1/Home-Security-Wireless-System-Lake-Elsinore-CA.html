When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
