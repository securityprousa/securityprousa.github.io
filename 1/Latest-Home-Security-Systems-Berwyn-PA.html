<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
