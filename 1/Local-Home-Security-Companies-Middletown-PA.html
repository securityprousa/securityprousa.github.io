<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home.
