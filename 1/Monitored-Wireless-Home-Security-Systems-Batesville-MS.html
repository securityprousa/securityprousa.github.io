<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who truly is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing seeing outside a window it could be a crime, yet the exact same person could place a surveillance camera then from another location see an individual within the privacy of their home.
