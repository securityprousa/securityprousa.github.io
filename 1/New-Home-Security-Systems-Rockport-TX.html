We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
