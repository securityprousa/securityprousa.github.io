The instructions are exceptionally extensive and the 200m variety of the alarm system suggests it can be used to secure garages and sheds as well as your home.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.
