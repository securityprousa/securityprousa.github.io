We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out signals, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

The camera consists of functions like free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it doesn't take photos of activity and can't pan or move-- basic features discovered on a lot of surveillance cameras. </p>
