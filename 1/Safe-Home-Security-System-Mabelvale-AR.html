<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
