When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
