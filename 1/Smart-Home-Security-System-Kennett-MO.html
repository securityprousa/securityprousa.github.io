Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
