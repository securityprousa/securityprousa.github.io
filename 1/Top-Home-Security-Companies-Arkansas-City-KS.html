Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is the one of the best tools for supervising your home. Its wire-free design, high-resolution video, and cost effective cloud monitoring assist it stand above the competition. Still, it's one of the most pricey security cameras you can buy, so we think the Wyze Web cam Pan is a good option if you're aiming to conserve some dough.
