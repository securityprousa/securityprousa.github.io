<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
