The implicit validation for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. However suicide enemies are clearly not hindered by camera - and may even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited advantages that the system may provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
