<p>Heaven by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in progress. We've seen enhancements throughout our short time with the battery-operated camera, but we simply can't suggest a $200 camera that does not provide the ability to zoom video and will not be able to withstand outdoor temperatures below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.
