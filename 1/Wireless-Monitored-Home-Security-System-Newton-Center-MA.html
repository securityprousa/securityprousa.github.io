<p>The greatest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets activated while you're away, you have no visual ways of confirming if something is in fact wrong and how major the scenario is.

<h2>Focus On What Matters Most Newton Center</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.
