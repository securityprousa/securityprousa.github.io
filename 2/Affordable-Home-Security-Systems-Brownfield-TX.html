<p>This usually would enter a closet or energy room someplace in the facilities. It is utilized in older or larger systems to link the components. Typically you would discover a PCB with many terminals or antennas for connections. Many also have built-in backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port. Some may have a serial port for connection to a technician's computer for diagnostics. These are the real heart of the system. Many control (interface) panels link straight to this panel in older or bigger wired systems. In some cases, the interface does connect directly to the parts or service, but for the most part it is relayed through a center or primary panel.</p>
