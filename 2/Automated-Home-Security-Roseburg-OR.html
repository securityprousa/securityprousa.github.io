With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
