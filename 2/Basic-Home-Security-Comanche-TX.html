<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print.
