<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
