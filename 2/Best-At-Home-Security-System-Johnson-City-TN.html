<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by a things is known as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of identifying tiny distinctions in temperature.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
