<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the deck by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
