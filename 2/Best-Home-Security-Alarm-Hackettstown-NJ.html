<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Ring likewise does not support as lots of smart-home platforms as our other 2 picks.
