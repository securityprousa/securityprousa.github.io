Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of offered light, and as soon as the lighting becomes low or missing (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins since they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video.</p>
