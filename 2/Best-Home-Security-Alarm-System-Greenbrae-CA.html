<p>On the surface, these 2 camera categories might appear comparable, though if you had the ability to see within, the differences become apparent and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of offered light, and as soon as the lighting becomes low or missing (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins since they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video.</p>
<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at.
