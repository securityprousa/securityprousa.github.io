<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
