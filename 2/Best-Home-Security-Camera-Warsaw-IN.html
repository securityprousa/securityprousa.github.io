The innovation gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and enjoy it later on.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
