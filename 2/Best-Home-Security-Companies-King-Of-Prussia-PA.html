<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
