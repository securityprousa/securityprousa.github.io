Some individuals may want to sign up for service just for when they or their partner is out of town, for example.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
