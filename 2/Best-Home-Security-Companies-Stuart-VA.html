<p>I have actually blogged about consumer electronic devices for more than 15 years and have tested smart-home items that range from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers.

<p>The Private Security Camera Reward Program, administered by the Office of Victim Services and Justice Grants, motivates locals, businesses, non-profits and religious organizations to install security camera systems on their home and register them with the Metropolitan Cops Department (MPD).

<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt should be able to stand up to direct exposure to the components and should carry an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP rankings include two digits that tell you just how well the camera will hold up under most climate condition. The very first digit following the IP prefix informs you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid things such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection versus dust and dirt). The 2nd number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded versus close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is important.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a person and a vehicle, for example, permits you to cut down on unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
