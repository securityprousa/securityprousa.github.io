<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your home and belongings. In the event that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are standing by to react by instantly contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
