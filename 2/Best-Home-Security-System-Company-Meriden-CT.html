<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
