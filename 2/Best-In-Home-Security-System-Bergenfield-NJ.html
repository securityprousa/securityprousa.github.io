<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the minimal range of sensing units. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation products at an affordable rate, the one location where the company particularly excels is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
