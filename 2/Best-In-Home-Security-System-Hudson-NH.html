<h3>Wireless Security Home System in Hudson NH</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
