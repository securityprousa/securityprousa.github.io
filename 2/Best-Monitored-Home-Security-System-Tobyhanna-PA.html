I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, because obviously they car restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.

The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly two years of night, use and day images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when checking the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We have actually seen it highlight moths, mice, and cars and trucks.</p>

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security key captured throughout the network healing.</p>
