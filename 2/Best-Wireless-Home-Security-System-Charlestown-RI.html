<p>While every property owner stresses over break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically leading to false alarms.

<p>Cameras frequently transmit footage over the Internet, permitting operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location. In some cases, surveillance systems are paid for and operated by the cities themselves. However in other cases, citizens and services share surveillance camera video footage with policeman. As with any security system, the more equipment you add, the pricier it gets. Which rate leaps a lot when you include wise cameras to any Blue system.

<p>So far so regular. Things begin to get truly intriguing with the Nest's facial acknowledgment system.

Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
