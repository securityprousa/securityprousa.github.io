<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
