Monitors can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Fire sensors can be isolated, implying that when set off, they will not trigger the main alarm network. This is necessary when smoke and heat is purposefully produced. The owners of structures can be fined for producing incorrect alarms that squander the time of emergency workers.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
