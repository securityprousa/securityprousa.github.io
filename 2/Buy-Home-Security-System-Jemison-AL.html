<p>Consider it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be cost the low cost of forty dollars? It just does not build up. To use such low prices, producers should cut corners, and completion result is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in ideal conditions like intense sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain situations such as nanny cams or signing in on a pet, though when seeking to collect evidence of a crime they typically come up short.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
