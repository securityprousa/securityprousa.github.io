<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
