All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such occurrences.

If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't think that these concerns modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
