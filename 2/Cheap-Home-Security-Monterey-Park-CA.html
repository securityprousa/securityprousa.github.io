<h2>A Guide To Video Surveillance Systems Monterey Park</h2>
<p>Many home security cameras have a resolution of 1080p, but that doesn't suggest they all deliver the exact same quality.

<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
