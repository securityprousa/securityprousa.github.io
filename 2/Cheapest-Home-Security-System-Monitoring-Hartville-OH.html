<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which could be an affordable choice for customers in backwoods. We advise cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a little more if you wish to add extra functions, like a security camera. While a common agreement runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who want to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It also suggests that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape-record a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would suffice to send out even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
