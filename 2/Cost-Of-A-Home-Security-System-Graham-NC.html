<p>In short, the proliferation of surveillance cameras has actually rapidly reduced our ability to preserve privacy in public areas; and the advent of automated face recognition and other tracking technologies only accelerate this threat to personal privacy.

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
