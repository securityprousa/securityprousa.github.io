Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and getting in touch with leading researchers to ask about upcoming evaluations. Both published and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
<p>Recording the video footage from your security cameras needs disk drives or cloud based storage.
