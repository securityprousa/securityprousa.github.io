<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely common kind of two piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or generally closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the 2nd piece which includes a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based on whether or not the style is typically open or generally closed. This action coupled with an electrical existing (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control panel to discover a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are really common and are found either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can normally be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
