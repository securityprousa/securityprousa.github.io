<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
