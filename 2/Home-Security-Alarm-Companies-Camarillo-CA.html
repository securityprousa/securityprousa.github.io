<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically located in the entrance hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially bothersome your neighbours).

<p>Since they work utilizing a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of area to be taken up versus the quality of photo required or wanted). The greatest photo quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
