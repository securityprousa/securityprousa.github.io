<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
