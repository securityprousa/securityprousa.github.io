<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both animals and human beings. Because carbon monoxide is colorless and odor-free, the only method to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector. Fortunately, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the quantity of CO in your house rises to a dangerous level.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency since it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
