<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
