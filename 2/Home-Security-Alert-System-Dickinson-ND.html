<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>Doorbell Camera - Vivint's doorbell camera with night vision lets you see who's at your door anytime. It's set off by motion and sends out alerts to your smart phone as required. For instance, A visitor approached your door" will be sent out with video. Video is taped with a 180-degree lens, and a sound system lets you talk with visitors. In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover a whole room when positioned inside your home. It will cover a 5-tile radius if put on an outside wall.</p>

These consultations can be super valuable, but they can also sell you on a bunch of equipment you didn't think you required (and probably still don't).</p>
