<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more costly for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
