<p>While every property owner stresses over break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to false alarms. Innovation combination is one Vivint's strong suits. The company's remarkable mobile app has actually been extremely rated by users on both Google Play and the App Store.

Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations.

An image of that staff member exists on screen for verification (validating it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating happens.</p>

<p>A little more costly than our winning smart alarm, this system was nearly as easy to install and, throughout screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensing units had been activated. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false alerts).
