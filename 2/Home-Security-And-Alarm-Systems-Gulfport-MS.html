<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease crime. Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording system, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complex - especially if your home has actually currently been built - so make certain to consult with an expert before handling the job yourself. Wired home security cameras send information through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not prone to interference such as cellular and radio frequencies. If you have a big home or residential or commercial property that requires thorough protection, wired systems are a much better option since they can support more cameras.</p>

<p>Some alarm systems are geared up with infrared sensing units that can detect and disregard family pets under 40 pounds or so. Having a pet-friendly alarm will help avoid incorrect alarms.

<p>Justin was considerate and incredibly professional, giving us outstanding customer support. We upgraded to wireless security and he was extremely patient as he discussed how to add the app to our phones, and provided me an extremely well done personal training session on the details of the Safe Touch web page.

<p>Because they work using a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer, these cameras do not require a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of photo needed or preferred). The highest photo quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
