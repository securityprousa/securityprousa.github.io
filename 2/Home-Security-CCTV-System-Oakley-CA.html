<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent alternative for long variety situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.
