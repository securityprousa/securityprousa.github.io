As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
