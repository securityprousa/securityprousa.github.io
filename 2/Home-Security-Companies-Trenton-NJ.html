<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>The greatest, baddest feature is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which offers you incredibly crisp, clear footage that lets you zoom in on details like faces and license plates without messing up your image quality. The Nest Labs Nest Webcam provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Ramping up into security services fits with this, too.
