<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
