<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems planned to summon authorities department personnel, needs registration, assessment of costs for extreme incorrect burglar alarms, provides treatments for repeat wrongdoers, and offers an effective date. Another big feature is night vision. You might likewise think about a camera with a built-in motion-activated light-- all the better to frighten you with, my dear!
