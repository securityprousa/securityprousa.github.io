<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The smart bit is that the camera not just spots that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of view, however it will also have a stab at recognising them too.
