<p>Ring might not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually gotten quite the excitement throughout the years. We've been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security set that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you pick the complimentary self-monitor" option.</p>
<p>You can configure it to catch anything from a reasonable field of view right as much as a full 180-degree fish-eye, and that HDR picture comes with tremendous colour depth also.

<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which might be a budget-friendly option for clients in rural areas. We advise cellular systems since they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate inside or inside - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is simple to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of expert monitoring.</p>
