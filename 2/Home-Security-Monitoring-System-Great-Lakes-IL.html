<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
