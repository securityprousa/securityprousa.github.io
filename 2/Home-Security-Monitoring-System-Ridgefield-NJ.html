<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
