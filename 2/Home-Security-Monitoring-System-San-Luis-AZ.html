<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>Video and image feeds have shown invaluable for surveillance - however there's space for more performance by utilizing audio. People have five senses that jointly allow us to accurately range our environment. Therefore, it just makes sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more reliable. And since it's not practical to engage taste, odor, and touch from another location, the most efficient video surveillance systems integrate sight and hearing to improve security protection.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run inside your home or inside - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little gadget.
