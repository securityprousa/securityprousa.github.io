<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the patio by a certified electrical contractor (who takes place to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered the camera controls, I was reasonably pleased. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being viewed understand they're being seen, and you can choose to tape video or images and conserve them to your wise device on an impulse. </p>
