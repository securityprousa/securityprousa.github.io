<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
