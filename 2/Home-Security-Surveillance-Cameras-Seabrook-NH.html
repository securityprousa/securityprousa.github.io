When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

The other technique is to rip and change, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
