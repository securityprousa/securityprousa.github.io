<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
