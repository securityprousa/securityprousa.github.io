<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month.

There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have additional sensing units and essential fobs, too.</p>
