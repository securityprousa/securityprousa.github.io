Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to disregard items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
