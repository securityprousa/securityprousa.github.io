<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
