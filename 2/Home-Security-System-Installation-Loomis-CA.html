Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or a number of, they deal with your home's web network to send video footage right to your computer or mobile phone.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.
