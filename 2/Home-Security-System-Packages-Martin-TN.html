<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face acknowledgment software application. The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99).

If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the sound may frighten prospective intruders-- if you're lucky. However the police won't come until you personally call them. </p>
