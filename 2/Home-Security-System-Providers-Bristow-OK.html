<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
