<p>Although 1080p is usually the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are advantages to models with higher-resolution sensing units.

When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
