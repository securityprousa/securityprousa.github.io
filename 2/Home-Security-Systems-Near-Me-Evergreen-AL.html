<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
