<p>The 2nd crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill in-built alarm, so it operates as a home alarm as well as a security camera. That separates it from the products I have actually already written, and helps in part to explain its price. This Canary Flex is a home security camera that loads a huge punch in a little plan. It works either connected to power or with its integrated battery-- and it's the only Canary camera that you can use within and outdoors.</p>
<p>Lots of home security systems offer additional sensing units that provide protection beyond keeping out trespassers.
