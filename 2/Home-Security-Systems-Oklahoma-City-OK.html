Modern systems now have phenomenal capabilities", though these have produced understandable misgivings about the danger for personal privacy and potential abuse such abilities create. Porter therefore kept in mind that the Home Office and surveillance industry must make sure only hardware and software compliant with pertinent requirements, such as Secure by Default, is set up in public and personal spaces alike.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras.

When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera separately, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
