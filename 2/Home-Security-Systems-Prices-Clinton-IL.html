<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup procedure. This usually involves finding a spot for your camera, creating an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. A lot of them then allow you to set up the alert frequency and create activity monitoring zones, so the camera will catch motion only in designated locations-- a feature we discover required for high-traffic areas, which might activate a great deal of false alerts.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, usage equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and normally difficult contracts, and frequently rely on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually examined separately and do not suggest for the majority of people.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be hazardous to both animals and human beings. Since carbon monoxide gas is colorless and odor free, the only way to monitor damaging levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide detector. Fortunately, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the quantity of CO in your home increases to an unsafe level. With a wireless system, you can also receive push alerts on your phone or tablet that let you know there is a concern, even when you're not at home.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm but you're in a meeting with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed getaway and your spotty cell service indicates you do not get signaled until the next day? The noise might scare off potential trespassers-- if you're lucky if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the authorities won't come until you personally call them. </p>
