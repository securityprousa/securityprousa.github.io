<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
