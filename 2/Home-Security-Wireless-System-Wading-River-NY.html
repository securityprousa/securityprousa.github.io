<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
