<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their keys and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
