The Ring Stick Up Cam can be found in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside your home and outdoors. However neither can tape constantly, and they both need the Ring Safeguard strategy to capture recordings. Likewise, the wired version normally left gaps of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery variation left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to cut down on false signals.</p>
