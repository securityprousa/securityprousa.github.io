<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>

Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print.
