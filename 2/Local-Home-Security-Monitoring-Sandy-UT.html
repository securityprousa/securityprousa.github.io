<p>A system that needs a contract might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems normally don't come with in advance costs. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
