The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>The second important thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill in-built alarm, so it operates as a home alarm as well as a security camera. That distinguishes it from the products I've currently written, and helps in part to explain its cost. This Canary Flex is a home security camera that loads a huge punch in a little bundle.
