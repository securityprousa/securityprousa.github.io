<h3>Local Home Alarm Systems Batesville IN 47006</h3>
<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
