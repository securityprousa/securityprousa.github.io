<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Asset protection devices are designed to protect specific, concrete properties, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household treasures. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering innovation to prevent being disarmed. If the product to which the device has actually been attached is moved or disrupted, the sensor will activate an alarm.</p>
<p>The greatest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual methods of confirming if something is actually incorrect and how severe the scenario is.
