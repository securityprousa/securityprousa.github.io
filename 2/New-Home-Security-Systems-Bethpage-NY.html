<p>Numerous other models were disqualified due to efficiency concerns. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. If recording video footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable price, the one area where the company particularly excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
