We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

There are only 2 choices if there are no as-built files supplying functionality and configuration details to make this integration work. The first alternative, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or reluctant to offer those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to change and rip, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>

It also suggests that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might rapidly tape-record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you picture, would suffice to send even the most dedicated career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
