<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
