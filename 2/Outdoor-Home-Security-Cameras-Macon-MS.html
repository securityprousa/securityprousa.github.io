<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be a budget friendly option for consumers in backwoods.

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, however you'll pay a bit more if you want to include extra features, like a security camera. While a normal agreement runs 42 months (one of the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who wish to rent their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
