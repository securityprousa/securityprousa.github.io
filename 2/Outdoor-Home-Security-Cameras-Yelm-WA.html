<p>The second crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill inbuilt alarm, so it works as a home alarm system in addition to a security camera. That distinguishes it from the items I have actually currently written, and assists in part to explain its price.

It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control panel (also referred to as the alarm panel).

From the app, you can turn it on or off and even alter the color of the light, and if used with Arlo cameras, its motion sensor can activate the camera to record.

<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is important. In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a vehicle and an individual, for example, permits you to cut down on unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
