<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
