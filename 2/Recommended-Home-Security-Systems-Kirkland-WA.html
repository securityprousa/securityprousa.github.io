<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
