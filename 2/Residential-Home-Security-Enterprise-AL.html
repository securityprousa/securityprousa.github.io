<p>Buy a rechargeable battery base also and you can put the weatherproof camera throughout Wi-Fi range (it lasts approximately 3 months between charges).

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>

Customers can select anything from standard monitoring to full-on home security automation, with the best combination of gizmos and services to fit their needs. </p>
