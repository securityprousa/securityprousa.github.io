<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.
