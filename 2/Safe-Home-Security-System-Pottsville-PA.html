<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smartphone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
