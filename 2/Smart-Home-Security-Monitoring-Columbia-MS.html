<p>CCTV cameras are placed in locations where they are believed to be most efficient, which generally includes extremely inhabited towns, city centers, parking area, or different other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Considered that the positioning of these cameras is really important, the criminal offense patterns in areas of interest are usually studied for amount of times to recognize crime hotspots where cameras could possibly be put.

<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited variety of sensing units. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

<p>Big national alarm companies such as ADT often utilize exclusive communicators which will ONLY work with their main station.
