<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
