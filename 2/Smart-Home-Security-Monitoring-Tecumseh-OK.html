<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't think that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>
