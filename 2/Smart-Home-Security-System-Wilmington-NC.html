Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notices (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off).

The main difference is that the wired system couple with the other smart home gadgets to create a network of home security around your home. It can be managed from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control panel (likewise referred to as the alarm panel).
