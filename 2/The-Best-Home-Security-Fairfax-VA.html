When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
