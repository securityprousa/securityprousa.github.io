<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All things discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature level. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level differences. Because items are rarely specifically the same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
