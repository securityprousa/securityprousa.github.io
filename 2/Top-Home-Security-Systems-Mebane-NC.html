<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range.
