<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
