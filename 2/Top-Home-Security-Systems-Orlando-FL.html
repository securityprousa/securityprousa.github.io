<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies?

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
