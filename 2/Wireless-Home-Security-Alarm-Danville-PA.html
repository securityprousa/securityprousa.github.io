However, after almost two years of night, day and use images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.
