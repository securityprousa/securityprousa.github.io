<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
