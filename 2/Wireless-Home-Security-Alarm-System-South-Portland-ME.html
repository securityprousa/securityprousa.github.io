We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
