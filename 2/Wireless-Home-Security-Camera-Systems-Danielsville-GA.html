<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
