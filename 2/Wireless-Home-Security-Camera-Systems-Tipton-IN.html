<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection gadgets are designed to secure particular, concrete possessions, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and household treasures. These gadgets can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to avoid being disarmed.

<p>When motion is identified, nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will activate the camera to tape video.
