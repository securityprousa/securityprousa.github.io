Definitely not perfect-- but the associate asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control board over night.</p>

The one time where lag does become a little bit of a problem is in between discovering and recording motion. Since the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording, it takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it discovers motion. They might get past the camera before it had time to record them if a dubious bad guy was quickly enough.</p>
<p>Since they work using a digital signal which can be saved straight to a computer, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture required or preferred). The greatest image quality of DVD is only slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
