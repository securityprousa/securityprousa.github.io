<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
