<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
