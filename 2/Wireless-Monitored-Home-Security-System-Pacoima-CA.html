<p>Firstly, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's much better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of use, night and day images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We have actually seen it highlight moths, automobiles, and mice.</p>

Prior to devoting to a system, see if any of these extras can fit in your spending plan.</p>
<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I enjoy the Hive View's style - certainly the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list. The handsome shiny black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine came in a lovely rose-gold however you can also get it in silver) strikes the perfect balance in between good-looking and subtle enough to not accentuate itself.</p>
